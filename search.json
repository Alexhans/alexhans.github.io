    "text": "The Solution\nAfter some googling I came across suggestions to disable SSL verification with git config http.sslVerify \"false\" but that looked like it could induce some bad habits and it actually wouldn’t prevent tampering if, for instance, the user was pointed elsewhere instead of the proper original server.\nThat’s when Stack Overflow came into play and I found about this neat solution where you can associate a hostname with a given certificate that you store locally.\nSteps:\n1- Download the self signed certificate from the server and store it somewhere like /etc/ssl/certs\n/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-dev-01.pem\n/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-dev-02.pem\n2- Modify your git config (globally or per-repository) to associate hosts with certs:\n(From git config --help)\n\nhttp.sslCAInfo\n    File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. \n    Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAINFO environment variable.\nIn this case we’re going to do it globally by modifying ~/.gitconfig\n[http \"https://dev-server-01:/\"]\n    sslCAInfo = /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-dev-01.pem\n\n[http \"https://dev-server-02\"]\n    sslCAInfo = /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-dev-02.pem\nOr you can do it with the command line:\n$ git config --global http.\"https://dev-server-01/\".sslCAInfo /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-dev-01.pem\n$ git config --global http.\"https://dev-server-02/\".sslCAInfo /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-dev-02.pem\nOf course, this breaks the flow of those who were using HTTP and the IP address directly since you need the same name that appears in the certificate. That’s the one con I can think of and, if your users where not in the habit of doing so, you’ll better start getting them used to it.\nCheers\n\nWas this helpful? Do you do it another way?

    "text": "What problem are we solving?\n“When can we launch this?” is a recurring question in cross-functional teams, and the answer is often “ask the engineers”. But is that really necessary? Do scientists need to build and then hand off to engineers to rewrite code for scalability or reliability?\nI challenged this pattern since I wanted to scale without having to grow engineering headcount, and empower our scientists to deliver more impact independently. The original handover approach introduced delays, estimation misses, integration surprises, and iteration overhead.\n\nWhat we wanted to achieve:\n\nScale our team: Grow scientific output independent of engineering capacity.\nIterate in parallel, not sequentially: Team members collaborate building and integrating simultaneously, without waiting periods or handovers.\nShare easily reproducible code: Produce reproducible code and data that makes cross-team collaboration easy and transparent.\n\nInstead of building custom solutions, we used a small set of industry-standard tools, dbt (Data Build Tool) with SQL, Apache Airflow (using astronomer-cosmos), and Git, to create a simple system. Scientists now develop close to the domain, and their work is automatically orchestrated and deployed without engineers needing to rewrite or manage the code. There’s no custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) or platform, just clear conventions, smart defaults, and infrastructure-as-code. Engineers focus on building reusable capabilities while scientists focus on science and business logic."

    "text": "How dbt solves these problems\nData Build Tool (dbt) enables engineers and scientists alike to transform data using software engineering best practices. Crucially, there are no tradeoffs between scrappy exploration and production-ready code, the same code serves both purposes:\n\nProduction-ready from day one: The code scientists write IS the production code. No handovers, no rewrites, no “let me translate this for production.” Your development SQL becomes the scheduled pipeline automatically.\nCollaboration and early integration: Since both engineers and scientists can run the same dbt code, collaboration happens naturally from day one, fostering cross-domain learning and surfacing integration or reproducibility issues early, reducing project risk.\nSimple workflows that scale: A simple dbt run -s \"model_name+\" runs your model and all dependencies. The same code that works for individual data exploration works for production scheduling.\nModularity without orchestration headaches: dbt forces you to break apart monolithic SQL into focused models, but handles all the dependency management automatically, so you get the benefits of clean, debuggable code without the cognitive overhead of managing execution order.\nAutomatic lineage and documentation: dbt generates interactive dependency graphs showing how your models connect. Schema documentation automatically appears in the warehouse tables.\nBuilt-in quality controls: Define data tests that run automatically.\nBuilt for integration and extensibility: dbt integrates seamlessly with our existing AWS stack (Athena, Glue, Iceberg), internal services and datalakes and industry standard tools.\nCompliance and governance: Data policies can be built into packages, ensuring compliance and empowering your users to make the right tradeoffs around data handling."

Use like so:\n#   sleep 10; alert\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\"  \n\"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\nAs the comment says, using it is just a matter of writing the command you want, a semi-colon and the alias alert (Remember that semi-colon ; means execute after the previous command is finished, no matter the return code, unlike && which only executes the next command if return code is 0 (success).\nSo if you’re compiling and running tests in a project you could just do:\nmake test; alert\nand you’ll get notified whenever make test ends.\nBut what if you decided running that lengthy task is a good moment to step away from your computer and take a coffee break or talk with a coworker? How will you know when it’s done if you’re not in front of the computer to see the desktop notification?"

    "text": "Abstract\nAs LLM tools and agents emerge in the Airflow community, whether as plugins, MCP servers, or embedded agents, we lack a consistent way to benchmark across implementations and across versions of the same solution. This lightning talk highlights the need of an agreed-upon evaluation mechanism that enables us to measure, compare, and reproduce results when working with GenAI solutions in relation to Airflow. I’ll share what such mechanism could look like in practice. If you care about building trustworthy, testable GenAI systems (that could eventually fit into CI/CD workflows) and want to able to have grounded discussions when developing in this space, let’s lay the groundwork to test and compare our tools meaningfully.\n\n\nSlides and Transcript\n\nToward a Shared Vision for LLM Evaluation in the Airflow Ecosystem\nTranscript in VTT coming before 2026-02-01"
